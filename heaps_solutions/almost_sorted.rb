## Almost sorted

# Timestamped data may not always make it into the database in the
# perfect order. Server loads, network routes, etc. Your job is to
# take in a very long sequence of numbers in real-time and efficiently
# print it out in the correct order. Each number is, at most, `k` away
# from its final sorted position. Target time complexity is `O(nlogk)`
# and target space is `O(k)`.
